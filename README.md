## A repo for OME's workflow of integrating OME's machine readable sample collection.csv files with various combinations of:

1. Mooring data (.mat files). May only work for OCNMS .mat files
2. PPS data (.txt files)
3. Ocean Model data (.nc files)
4. CTD files (.ros files, or .cnv files, or .nc files)

So far this has only been tested with OCMS and EcoFoci's DY2306 and SKQ2021-15S
